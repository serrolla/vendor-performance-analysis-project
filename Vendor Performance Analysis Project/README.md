# 🧾 Vendor Performance Analysis – Power BI & Python Project

## 📊 Project Overview

This project provides a deep-dive analysis into vendor performance using both Python (for data cleaning and exploration) and Power BI (for visualization). It’s designed to uncover insights that support data-driven decisions in retail procurement and inventory management.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Retail and wholesale businesses often face inefficiencies due to:
- Poor vendor performance tracking
- High inventory holding costs
- Limited visibility into profitability per vendor
- Pricing and ordering inefficiencies

This project addresses these pain points with data-backed insights and dashboards.

## ✅ Objectives

- Identify underperforming vendors and brands
- Analyze how bulk purchasing affects unit costs
- Evaluate inventory turnover and its effect on profitability
- Measure statistical differences between vendor groups
- Deliver interactive reports for stakeholder use

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 📉 **Profit Leakage**: Found infinite negative margins due to discounts or missing revenue.
- 💼 **Vendor Concentration**: Top 10 vendors represent 65.69% of total purchase volume — risky.
- 💸 **Economies of Scale**: Bulk buying yields 72% lower unit prices on average.
- 🛑 **Inventory Inefficiencies**: $2.71M of inventory still unsold.
- 📊 **Significant Differences**: Profitability between vendors statistically validated.

## 🧠 Actionable Recommendations

- Reprice/promote high-margin, low-volume items
- Reduce vendor dependence by diversifying procurement
- Leverage bulk purchasing for better cost control
- Address unsold stock via clearance or better planning
- Improve vendor relations with poor performance metrics
